	<h1>Github pages test with webpack</h1>

	<p>
		OK, so far I can have webpack output outside of the project folder, so that's cool.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't think I want to have nested git repos. So the project folder will have a different git repo than the actual github pages. So I can work on the /src code, commit it and bundle it, then commit and push the /dist to the github pages.
	</p>
	<p>
		The editor only needs the project folder. But I'll need 2 terminals, one for each repo.
	</p>
	<p>
		'gh-pages' is cool, but that won't work for this as far as I can tell.
